# Data Procurement & Specifications <br/>

UTKFace:- ~23K cropped face images with age,gender and race <br/>

UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of ~23K face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. The images cover large variation in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc. This dataset could be used on a variety of tasks, e.g., face detection, age estimation, age progression/regression, landmark localization, etc. <br/>

Images are alligned and only contains cropped faces<br/>

Images show variation in pose, facial expression, illumination and resolution.<br/>
